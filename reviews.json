        "review contents": "I had a MacBook Pro i7 16, and I decided to change for the M3, and in general I see great significant changes in performance and processing. The focus is more on software development, which is my job. Although I have seen many reviews, regarding its predecessors such as the M1 and M2 I would think that if you think about changing for this one, it is better to wait a bit since the change is not so big. But if you have a MacBook Pro with intel processors, I do recommend making the switch. At least in terms of development it is excellent, as long as you opt for this M3 version with 16 ram. I have been using it for 2 months now and everything is normal in relation to the battery, very demanding in performance. I could not say much for other areas such as design or video, but it is a great option."

I thought it might be too heavy as I have the 15\" MacBook Air as well, but it is slightly heavier than my 15\" Dell XPS laptop which this is replacing. Great screen, Mini LCD, which is close to the OLED on my Dell XPS 15.Recommended"
